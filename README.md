# Ball-Game
This is a game made with Unity. While the name "ball game" is not permanent, you get the idea about what the game is about. You are a ball that can roll to navigate levels. You can use the (sort of) framework that I have set up that allows you to manually create levels. Commit levels that you think are worthy to be in the master branch final game!
