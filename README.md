# Ball-Game
This is a game made with Unity.
While the name "ball game" is not permanent, you get the idea about what the game is about.
You are a ball that can roll to navigate levels.
You can use the (sort of) framework that I have set up that allows you to manually create levels.
Create levels that you think are worthy to be in the final game!

The framework is just elements that you can place to create that includes (as of 05/21/20 8:45):
    Blue Lights
    Red Lights
    Blue Lights Slanted
    TileBasic
    TileBasicBackground
    UpgradeTokens (upgrades not enabled yet)
    Door 1
    Hatch 1
    And more!

Of course, you can always make your own elements

To load the project in Unity, simply add the folder "BallGame" to your Unity projects on the Unity Hub!

If you have no experience with Unity's Lightweight Rendering Pipeline's experimental 2D graphics, I do recommed that you read up on it.

Use command-d to duplicate objects, and then command-drag to snap drag those objects so that they match up with others.
